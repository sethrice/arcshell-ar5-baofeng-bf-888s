## DIY Programming Cable

To program your Arcshel AR-5 radios, you'll need a programming cable like this one:

![Baofeng USB Programming Cable](Baofeng-USB-Programming-Cable.webp)

You can either purchase one or create your own using a USB to Serial FTDI converter. Here's a diagram for the DIY programming cable:
